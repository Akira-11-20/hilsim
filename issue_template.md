# Issue Template for RTT Measurement Improvements

## Title
Implement real-time RTT monitoring and analysis dashboard

## Description

### Background
Recently implemented synchronized timestamp-based RTT measurement that successfully eliminated negative RTT values and improved measurement accuracy.

### Current Status
- ✅ Negative RTT values eliminated (was -2500ms → now 0 occurrences)
- ✅ RTT range stabilized (was 18-40ms → now 18-21ms)
- ✅ Occasional 40ms spikes identified as normal ZMQ buffering behavior
- ✅ Detailed timing logs implemented

### Proposed Enhancement
Create a real-time RTT monitoring dashboard to:

1. **Live RTT Visualization**
   - Real-time RTT graph during simulation
   - Statistical summary (min/max/avg/std)
   - Alert system for abnormal values

2. **Performance Analysis**
   - RTT distribution histogram
   - Timing breakdown analysis
   - Communication success rate tracking

3. **System Health Monitoring**
   - Sync protocol status
   - Buffer overflow detection
   - Network latency trends

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] Add WebSocket endpoint for live data streaming
- [ ] Create web-based dashboard using plotly/dash
- [ ] Implement RTT threshold alerting
- [ ] Add performance metrics export

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time RTT monitoring during simulation
- [ ] Historical RTT data analysis
- [ ] Performance bottleneck identification
- [ ] Documentation and usage examples
